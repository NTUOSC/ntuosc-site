# NTUOSC Site

Landing page & blog for National Taiwan University Open Source Community. This repository holds the ground-up site source.

## Prerequisites

This website is generated using [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). To install all the Python dependencies, simply run the following command:

    [sudo] pip install pelican Markdown Fabric

If you're tweaking the site stylesheet, make sure to install [Bower](http://bower.io) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com):

    [sudo] npm install -g bower
    [sudo] gem install sass

And run

    bower install

to fetch all the required frontend components.


## To build

[Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org) is used to do all the automation works. To list available commands, try:

    fab --list

And run either `fab build` or `fab serve` to generate pages or run the site locally.

`fab sass` compiles SCSS stylesheets into compressed CSS. Here are some possible usages:

    fab sass
    fab sass:watch
    fab sass:compile,force build serve
    fab sass:,,style=expanded,sourcemap=auto

See SASS and Fabric documentation for more options.

### Issues on Modernizr

One of bower dependencies of the site, Modernizer, is not a regular bower package. You will get the repo directly when installing, and you have to build it yourself before building (before pelican copies its assets). Currently there is no simply workarounds to automate this process, so watch out when deploying.

Here we build all components of Modernizr, which is generally unnecessary.

    cd vender/modernizr
    npm install
    ./bin/modernizr -c lib/config-all.json

Copying the whole repo of Modernizr into `output/` directory is also a stupid idea, which is an issue to be fixed.

## Deployment

Before publishing the site, make sure you've set up correct `git` remote branches already:

    git remote add github https://github.com/NTUOSC/ntuosc.github.io.git

Note that weʻre deploying to root GitHub Pages repository. To change the behavior, modify `fabfile.py` in the project directory as your wish.

When you‘re all set, run the following command,

    fab github

to publish the site on GitHub Pages.
